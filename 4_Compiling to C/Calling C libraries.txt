ctypes

    ctypes is a foreign function library for Python, It provides C compatible data types,
and allows calling functions in DLLs or shared libraries. It can be used to wrap these
libraries in pure Python. Will also work with Fortran libraries.

cffi

    Realizing that ctypes can be quite cumbersome to use at times, cffi attempts to simplify
many of the standard operations that programmers use. It does this having an internal C
parser that can understand function and structure definitions.
    As a result, we can simply write the C code that defines the structure of the library we
wish to use, and then cffi will do all the heavy work for us: it is imports the module and
makes sure we specify the correct types to the resulting functions. In fact, this work can
be almost trivial if the source for the library is available, since the header files will
include all the relevant definitions we need.

CPython Module

    Finally, we can always go right down to the CPython API level and write a CPython
module. This requires us to write code in the same way that CPython is developed ant take
care of all of the interactions between our code and the implementation of CPython.
    This has the advantage that it is incredibly portable, depending on the Python version.
We don't require any external modules or libraries, just a C compiler and Python! However,
this doesn't necessarily scale well to new versions of Python. For example, CPython modules
written for py 2.7 won't work with py 3, and vice versa.
    All in all, this method should be left as a last resort. While it is quite informative
to write a CPython module, the resulting code is not as reusable or maintainable as other
potential methods.
    Without example.
