    A profile is a set of statistics that describes how often and for how long various parts
of the program executed. This will help you to find a place of problem part in the code, so
you'll know what to improve or change.

    Strategies to Profile Your Code Successfully
    • Disable Turbo Boost in the BIOS.
    • Disable the operating system’s ability to override the SpeedStep (you will find
      this in your BIOS if you’re allowed to control it).
    • Use only AC power (never battery power).
    • Disable background tools like backups and Dropbox while running experiments.
    • Run the experiments many times to obtain a stable measurement.
    • Possibly drop to run level 1 (Unix) so that no other tasks are running.
    • Reboot and rerun the experiments to double-confirm the results.
